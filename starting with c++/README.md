## History of C++
### Bjarne Stroustrup created c++.
  + According to hime c++ is extended version of c, where he introduced concept of classes in 1979. in AT & T's Bell Labs.
  + Early name of c++ was **c with classes** it's officially became c++ in 1983.

## Facts about c++
  + c++'s OOP aspect was inspired by a computer simulation language called simula67.
  + **java** is written in c++.
  + Major operating systems of modern times are written in c++, along with some famous libraries like numpy.
## Features of C++
  - C++ is a **middle level language**
      - it's mean it can behave like low level as well as high level language.
      - low level language which uses to create system dependent programs like operating system, drivers, etc.
      - High level language use to create software that are independent of OS.
  - C++ supports principles of **object-oriented** paradigm.
  - c++ joins three separate programming traditions.
      - The **procedural language** tradition, represented by c.
      - The **object-oriented** language tradition, represented by the class enhancements c++ adds to c.
      - **Generic programming**, supported by c++ templates.
## comparison between c and c++
  - c++ is a super set of c language.
  - c++ programs can use existing c software libraries.
  - c follows **top-down** approach of programming.
      - **Top-down** means first we define the outline of program then after we define its code snipper like function, etc.
  - c++ follws bottom-up approach of programming
      - its mean that we need to define the definition of all function thenwe struture the program.
  - c adopts **procedure oriented** programming.
  - c++ adopts **object-oriented** programming.
      - OOPs is a programming approach which revolves around the concept of **object**.
      - that can be defined as a set of properties and set of operations performed using entity's property set, is known as object.
## Concept of Classes and Object
  - class is blueprint of an object.
  - class is description of object's property set and set of operations.
  - creating class is as good as defining a new data type
  - class is a means to achieve encapsulation
  - object is a run time entity
  - object is an instance of class.

## Identifier in c++
  - constant
      - any information is constant.
      - data = information = constant
    - type of constant
        - primary
            - integer (23, -34, 0, etc)
            - real (3.4, -0.06, etc)
            - character ('a', '4', '-', '&', etc)
        - secondary
            - created from primary identifiers
            - array, string, pointer, union, structure, enumerator, class
  - variables
      - variables are the name of memory locations where we store data.
      - variables name is any combination of alphabet (a to z or A to Z), digit(0 to 9) and underscore(_).
      - valid variable cannot start with digit.
  - keywords
